            It's cold, and its windy, which adds to the wind chill factor.

            a great bronze door.

            The walls in this room are padded, and slightly bloodstained.
            There appears to be a bucket filled with blood, sinew and teeth,
            and the remnants of someone's attempt at repairing a broken
            limb. All this proves quite impressive for the top of an oak tree.

            A simple wooden spear with a pointed tip. Not much for ornamentation
