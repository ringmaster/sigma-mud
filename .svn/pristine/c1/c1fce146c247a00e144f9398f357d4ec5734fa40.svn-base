      Settled in the center of the large plaza, the three-tiered onyx and marble fountain
      stands as a stark symbol of the city's wealth and status. A few children play freely
      around the fountain, seemingly oblivious to the endless crowds of people shuffling
      to whatever location they need to be.

      The narrow road wends southeasterly, and looking that direction, glimpses of the
      Central fountain are visible. bookending the streets are commoner's shops and
      guildhalls of the many craftsmen that live in Ravren. Dilapidation seemingly has
      gripped those shops, but with the proximity of the establishments to the Central
      Fountain probably means that the halls are not struggling, despite apperances.
      Caravans and townsfolk travel to and fro down this road, some travelling toward
      work, and others just finishing it.

    Several guildhalls line the road. From what you can see, there is a prominent cobbler

     The chaotic scene of one of the busiest intersections in Ravren is a sight to behold.
     The smell of caravans' pack animals pervades the area, as the crowds move to and fro
     in waves in each direction. Several heavily armed guards are visible, flanking the
     several entrances to the Great Bank of Ravren, which lies off the south, on Mage's
     Street.

  The area is sparsely populated, undoubtedly because of the presence of the Necromanse

  The entrance to the de-facto northern district of the commoners is on this illustrious
  Mage's Street, though, this particular segment shows little of the shine found southward.
  Workers, fresh from their employ trudge home, as their replacements move in the opposite

  The fanfare heard from the south is a stark contrast to the ponderous sounds of common life
  heard here. Workers build homes here, which based on the material and construction, will
  be for the ever-burgeoning commoner population. Traders, which can be seen southward, appear
  to avoid this area, keeping the traffic to a minimum.

  Commotion from the intersection with Regent's can be heard from the north, while traffic

  in this segment of Mage's, as can be seen by the stately edifices that face the streets.
  Facades of multi-colored bricks and ivy are encompassed by high fences and highly paid

  Homes line this main corridor of Ravren, yet the road remains lively. Caravans transporting
